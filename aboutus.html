        <h5>Kawasaki Team</h5>
        <p>Kawasaki continues to strengthen and expand its capabilities in aircraft engine development and production by manufacturing helicopter engines for Ministry of Defence, and participating in the joint international development and production of turbofan engines for such passenger aircraft as the V2500, the RB211/Trent, the PW4000 and the CF34, and aircraft auxiliary power units (APU).
            The Company technological capabilities are also honed through its participation in the research and development of an environment friendly small aircraft engine.
            Kawasaki participation in space development began with work for NASDA, currently the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), on the N rocket launch complex, an acoustic test facility, and an experimental geodetic satellite.
            Since the 1990s, the Company has been responsible for the development and production of the payload fairings, payload attach fittings (PAF) and the construction of the launch complex for the H-II rocket. It continues to provide services for the H-IIA rocket.</p>
